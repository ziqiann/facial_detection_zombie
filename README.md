VR Glasses to Ease Stage Fright

Problem Statement: Many people feel nervous or anxious when speaking in front of an audience. By using VR glasses, 
speakers can alter their perception of the audience, turning them into less intimidating figures (like zombies or abstract forms), reducing stress and boosting confidence.

Proposed Solution: Create lightweight VR glasses that use face detection and real-time visual overlays to transform an audience's appearance. 
The glasses will utilize a small camera and precise sensors to recognize faces and apply visual filters in real-time.
